# Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to assess my **skills and approach to composing a simple web app** given a set of screens and an API feed by writing a simple React web app.

Using the screens provided in the challenge as a reference, an app to display movie and series titles need to build a set of React components to render the app. You'll also need to request a JSON feed, filter that data, and use the relevant fields.

This challenge is expected to take about 2-4 hours.

## Running the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## The Challenge

Using the provided screens as a reference, the challange is to build 3 pages:

* A "Home" page - to access series or movies
* A "Series" page - displaying series
* A "Movies" page - displaying movies

It also requires requesting a JSON feed, filtering that data, and using the relevant fields.
